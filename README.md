# Person and Hobby Management

This Java program demonstrates the management of people and their hobbies using various classes such as `Person`, `Hobby`, `Address`, and `Country`. The program utilizes a `TreeSet` with custom comparators to sort `Person` objects by name and age and a `HashMap` to associate each `Person` with a list of their hobbies.

## Classes

- `Person`: Represents an individual with a name and age.
- `Hobby`: Describes a hobby, including its name, frequency, and a list of addresses where it can be practiced.
- `Address`: Represents an address with street, city, and country details.
- `Country`: Represents a country.

## Usage

The program performs the following tasks:

1. Creates `Address`, `Hobby`, `Country`, and `Person` objects with associated information.
2. Creates a `HashMap` that associates `Person` objects with lists of their hobbies.
3. Uses custom comparators to sort `Person` objects by name and age and prints the sorted lists.
4. Prints the names of hobbies and the countries where they can be practiced for a specific person (e.g., Alice).

You can explore the code and customize it further for your specific needs.

Enjoy exploring the management of people and their hobbies!
